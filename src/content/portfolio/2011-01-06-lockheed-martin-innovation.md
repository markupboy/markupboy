When Lockheed Martin needed a engaging new showcase for their best and brightest research and development projects, they came to [Viget](http://www.viget.com). Fitting in to their existing brand identity and highlighting their complex and outrageous work, we had the opportunity to build a fully standards-based web gallery with custom tailored animations and interactions.

My responsibilities on this project included all HTML, CSS and JavaScript work as well as motion design and some user interaction design.
