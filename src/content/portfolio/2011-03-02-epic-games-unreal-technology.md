Epic Games needed a web presence for their Unreal Engine that matched it's unparalleled technology and design. Viget delivered and with the help of [nGen Works](http://www.ngenworks.com) had a fully customized ExpressionEngine install to match.

My role in the Epic Games project was as lead front-end developer - building-out the site layout, structure and templates and added interactive features and touches through JavaScript and CSS3.
