Cisco was looking for a way to bring a little more fun to teleconferencing. What resulted was a single page micro-site with the ridiculousness of a carnival. With a heavy dose of CSS3 animation and tons of interactivity, Welcome to Your Meeting is a conferencing utility unlike any other. For this project, I served as the front-end developer and was responsible for the daunting task of implementing all design and interaction on the site.
