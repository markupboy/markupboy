Viget Labs happens to be the proud owners of an original, working 1981 Ms. Pac-Man cocktail table. Collecting dust, unused for years, the front-end development team decided to give her new life in our little corner of the office. Being a fully working, 30 year-old arcade machine, we wanted to make sure we took as best care of her as possible which unfortunately meant powering her off when not in use wiping any high scores set each time.

A simple web app proved to be just what we needed. Built on top of the Django framework for Python, Viget Ms. Pac-Man is a fully featured score aggregation system. Scores are submitted by registered players via Twitter (a typical tweet looking like "@vigetmspacman 22560") and logged by the app at a preset interval. Scores are used to display a universal Top 10 list, show global statistics and graphs (such as average score, games played per day and total points earned) as well a per user statistics and even achievements.

This fun side-project was wholly my own. Every aspect including back-end development, visual design, front-end implementation, Twitter integration and even a public API was hand-crafted by yours truly.
