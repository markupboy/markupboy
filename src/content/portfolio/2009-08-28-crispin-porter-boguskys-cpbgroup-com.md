Served as lead interface architect and developer for Crispin Porter’s radical redesign of their homepage — CPBGroup.com. This single page social media aggregator features a fully accessible and SEO friendly Ajax interface with highly complex real-time updating and JavaScript animation.

My contribution included overseeing all front-end development, visual design implementation and creation of a custom event-driven JavaScript framework to manage all client-side interaction.
