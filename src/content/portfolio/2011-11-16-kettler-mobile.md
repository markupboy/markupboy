Kettler property management has been a long-standing client of Viget's. Wanting to extend their reach and provide more utility for their customers, we were tapped to build a mobile experience catering to on-the-go users. Leveraging the existing ExpressionEngine platform, Kettler's new mobile site feature property search, listings, photo galleries, maps and more all in a pint-sized package. For this project, I served as front and backend developer, building out the interface as well as integrating on ExpressionEngine including custom development for integrating with Kettler's third party pricing and availability system.
