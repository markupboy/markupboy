As a budding gaming startup, Rumble Games needed a high quality site to represent their work. Built on ExpressionEngine and utilizing custom written add-ons to tap into their external user authentication and management suite, the Rumble Games site is rock solid and highly customizable end-to-end. Including blog posts, news, press releases, careers, team profiles, and even dynamically generated top-level sections for games - Rumble is empowered to keep their content fresh and on target. For this project I served as the integration engineer, taking highly polished designs and build-out work and bringing them to life with ExpressionEngine and custom written addons for user authenticaion.
