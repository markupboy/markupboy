Served as lead interface architect and developer for Burger King’s redesign of their online corporate identity at BK.com.

My contribution included overseeing all front-end development, creating a custom, modular CSS framework which aides in flexible layout generation for all corporate pages, building a stand-alone, easily modified version of the site to be used for vendor implementations and implementing numerous JavaScript pieces including a multi-source overlay video player.
