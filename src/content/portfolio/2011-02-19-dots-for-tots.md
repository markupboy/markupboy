Dots For Tots harnesses the power of Ms. Pac-man, and our irrational love for her, for good.

We’re raising funds for Child’s Play Charity by playing Ms. Pac-man for as long as your donations keep us going. We’re just a handful of web nerds at Viget Labs. Long ago, our awesome client Squidoo gifted us with our own Ms. Pac-man machine. Little did they know the Pac-man fever they would one day incite in our office.

On March 25th, we’ll turn our productivity-sucking addiction into a worthy cause, with the help of your donations. You’ll support a great cause and get to see on live, streaming video full-grown, 21st century adults obsess over a 30 year-old arcade game.
