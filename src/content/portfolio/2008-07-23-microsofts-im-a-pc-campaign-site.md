To prove that PC’s aren’t just nerdy guys in bad suits that all look like John Hodgman, Microsoft launched Windows’ “I’m a PC” campaign. Accepting video and photo submissions of "PC’s" around the world, we built an endless wall of the community for all the world to see. To target the largest amount of visitors possible, one version of the wall was created fully in JavaScript utilizing custom-built velocity and distance-based animation (as opposed to traditional tween animation) and mouse position detection that achieved stunning results and huge amounts traffic.
