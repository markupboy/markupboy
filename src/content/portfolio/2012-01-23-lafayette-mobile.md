Having built Lafayette's main site, Viget was tapped to add a dedicated mobile experience to their .edu specifically targeting students on campus. For my part, I served as front and backend engineer - building out the front-end of the site and creating custom WordPress themes and plugins to augment Lafayette's existing platform. Ultimately, the work was rolled out to dozens of subsites across all of Lafayette's departments and utilizes custom written PHP to tap into their online directory and calendaring.
