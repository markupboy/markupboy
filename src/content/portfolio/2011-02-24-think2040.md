Built for the Roosevelt Institute, Think2040 is a microsite dedicated to gathering information about our nations values and educating users on changes going on in today's society.

Highlights of this project include extensive custom JavaScript work, linking non-video assets to changes in a Vimeo video player utilizing Vimeo's JS API, CSS3 work including 3d transforms and a custom parallax scrolling background. My responsibilities were full build-out of all HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the site.
