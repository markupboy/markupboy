With the introduction of iCloud, Apple quietly did something pretty special for nerds like me with a ton of machines - Back to My Mac was finally free.

Sure, you could open up finder, find your remote machine in the "Shared" list, click on it, wait, and then click on "Share Screen" or we can just use Alfred.

With this little extension installed, just fire up Alfred and plug in `vnc` followed by the name of a machine you have Back to My Mac setup on and that's it, you'll be screen sharing in no time.
