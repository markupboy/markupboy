<p>It's no secret I seriously admire <a href="http://www.simplebits.com">Dan Cederholm</a> and <a href="http://corkd.com">his work</a>.  Needless to say, getting to see him speak at <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com">An Event Apart</a> was a huge moment for me.  To honor this oh so special of occasions I whipped up a TextMate theme based around the color combinations from Dan's presentation. Enjoy:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've recently been splitting my time between TextMate and Vim and am in the process of porting and configuring a Handcrafted Vim colorscheme.  This is very much a work in progress but feel free to <a href="/downloads/handcrafted.vim">download a copy of handcrafted.vim</a>.</p>
