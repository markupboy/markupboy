I never knew the real joy of using the terminal until my friend Brian turned me on to [ZShell](http://www.zsh.org/). Ever since, I've customized my shell and my terminal workflow to make navigating and handling files and paths as simple as possible.

In [my Github account](http://www.github.com/markupboy) I've posted my somewhat ridiculous [dotfile](http://www.github.com/markupboy/dotfiles) configuration. There you'll find:

- My aliases and binding for things like zshell, screen, vim and git
- the ridiculous prompt i use that's setup to display current host, directory, git branch and the status of the working copy (is it ahead/behind the remote repo, if there are any uncommitted changes)
- a rake task to install it all
