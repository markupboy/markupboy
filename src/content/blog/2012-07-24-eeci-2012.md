The details for [this year's EECI](http://eeciconf.com) were posted just yesterday and I can't even begin to explain how excited I am to be speaking. Well, excited and terrified as there are a ton of really great speakers and, if last year in Brooklyn was any indication, one of the sharpest groups of attendees I've met at any conference.

For my part, I'll be speaking about writing custom plugins for your projects. Everything from how to get started and the basics of plugin authoring to more advanced features and how to leverage some of ExpressionEngine's CodeIgniter backbone to accomplish even more custom work without overburdening your templates with inline PHP.
