AnandTech just posted a [review of Apple's new Thunderbolt display](http://www.anandtech.com/show/4832/the-apple-thunderbolt-display-review/1). All in all it sounds like a great deal for Apple laptop owners.  But then there's this:

> That's right, the only way to get video to the Thunderbolt Display is by using a Thunderbolt enabled Mac (or theoretically a Thunderbolt enabled PC). For Mac users that means only 2011 MacBook Pro, Air, iMac or Mac mini models will work with the Thunderbolt Display.

Which means that if I were to buy a Mac Pro from the apple store right now, I'd have to go somewhere else to buy a display. That's the most un-Apple-like thing I've seen Apple do in a long time.
