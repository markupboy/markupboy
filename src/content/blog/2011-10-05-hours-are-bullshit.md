> By allowing for a more flexible work schedule, you create an atmosphere where employees can be excited about their work. Ultimately it should lead to _more_ hours of work, with those hours being even _more_ productive. Working weekends blur into working nights into working weekdays, since none of the work _feels_ like work.

A great post from [Zach Holman](http://www.zachholman.com) on operating hours at GitHub. For me, I know that even though I'm in the office at 8:30 or 9 in the morning, on most days I don't actually start being _truly_ productive until after lunch.
