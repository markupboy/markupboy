Using a bundle you're not quite familiar with in TextMate?  Don't remember exactly what snippet use to generate the model stub in Django (just like me five minutes ago)?  Fortunately, TextMate as always has you covered.  Pressing CTRL + CMD + T will bring up the "Select Bundle Item" window, allowing you to easily search the current bundles list of snippets and commands.
