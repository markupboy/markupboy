Hands down my largest ExpressionEngine site to date - Duke Admissions is a complete re-imagining of what it means to connect with prospective students and convey what life at Duke is truly like. Each and every page is handcrafted, and all content fully customizable, thanks to ExpressionEngine's unparalleled power and flexibility. To help Duke create and maintain such a large volume of copy and photos, the EE control panel has been customized on per page basis and allows Duke's editors to update the site with ease. For my part, I served as lead front-end and integration developer - leading a small team through build-out and integrating and customizing the ExpressionEngine installation.
