Served as lead interface architect and developer for the second phase of Coke Zero's Fannovation campaign â€” fannovation.posterous.com. Working with the Posterous team to build a custom front-end for their blogging platform, the Fannovation site allowed anyone to blog their ideas for great Coke Zero March Madness tie-in campaigns for a chance to win $10,000 and a trip to the 2011 Final Four.

My contribution included all front-end development, visual design implementation and Posterous system integration.
