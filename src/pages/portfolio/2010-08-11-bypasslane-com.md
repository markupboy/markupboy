Served as lead front-end developer for the web application Bypasslane.com. Billed as a way to revolutionize the way sports fans and event goers order refreshments in stadiums, the Bypass project spanned multiple digital mediums including the desktop web, a mobile web app and a bespoke, in browser, touch-based point-of-sale system.

My contribution included front-end development for all three platforms.
