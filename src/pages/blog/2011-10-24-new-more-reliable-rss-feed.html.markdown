Last night I discovered that my RSS feed was down for the count. After a ton of debugging, some gnashing of teeth, and googling how to properly write a 301 redirect in an htaccess file, I think I've cracked it.

The original feed should continue to work and all of the old urls for that feed should be redirecting to it. There is also an new alternate feed at [feeds.feedburner.com/markupboy](http://feeds.feedburner.com/markupboy) that will be the new canonical feed going forward.
