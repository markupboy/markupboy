![Single Entry](single_entry.png)

Have you ever had a channel in an ExpressionEngine installation that required its own set of custom fields, but only needed one entry? Perhaps a homepage or an "About Us" section that needed its own custom content but wasn't a traditional list of posts? Single Entry can help. With a few simple settings, your control panel can be set up to easily create and edit these posts without the risk of adding new and unnecessary entries to these channels.

Once configured, Single Entry moves your single entry channels out of EE’s standard publish and edit workflow and into a new section of your content dropdown.  From there, you’ll have quick access to creating and editing the individual entries in those channels without the hassle of navigating through the standard EE edit workflow or accidentally creating a new entry in a channel that can’t use one.

Best of all, your data and development workflow aren’t changed in any way. Single entry channels are still completely native and can be assigned custom field groups, category groups and statuses, and used in templates just like always. And through the configuration panel, even the name of the new section in the content dropdown can be customized.

Single Entry is Viget's first ever commercial ExpressionEngine Addon and available exclusively at [Devot-EE](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/single-entry)
