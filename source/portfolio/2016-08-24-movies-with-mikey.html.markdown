When Mikey Neuman - Borderlands writer, creative dude at Gearbox Software, and all around great internet guy - needed a new site for his YouTube series Movies with Mikey, I was fortunate enough to be selected to help out.

What came out was a single page Wordpress site, designed and built to require as little human interaction as possible to maintain. New video panels are automatically pulled in upon upload, non-video panels are managed right in the Wordpress admin, and the layout is both responsive (working on the tiniest of phones up to the highest of resolution monitors) and constantly fresh with the latest video always featured up top and a random assortment of content down below.
