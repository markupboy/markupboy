_Markupboy.com is written and produced by Blake Walters  &mdash; Interactive developer, markup nerd and standardista hailing from a time when the font tag was acceptable._

My career as I know it started way back in 1995. I designed and built my first website that yearâ€¦ using Microsoft Word. It was awful. Later that same year, though, I had my first paying job as a freelance web-designer - $50 from a local church music group for a website full of frames, tables, and font tags. Of course, I was 12 at the time and didn't know any better. Now, 17 years later, the fundamentals of what I do haven't changed and neither has how much I love doing it. Fortunately for me (and for my career), I've given up the font tags and tables for CSS and semantic HTML and even picked up a few server-side languages.

Presently my focus is on front-end web development emphasizing standards, accessibility and the end-user experience. I constantly strive for pixel perfect implementations, highly flexible and reusable code and the highest quality craftsmanship for all of my work. [ExpressionEngine](http://www.expressionengine.com) is my platform of choice for building responsive, scalable, and easily maintainable websites and I turn to [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for building custom web applications.

I currently reside near Boulder, CO and am a happily employed Front-End Developer at [Big Cartel](http://www.viget.com) as well as a part-time freelance web developer.
