I'll have a more extensive write up later (thought [EE Insider's write-up](http://eeinsider.com/blog/blake-walters-practical-tips-for-writing-custom-plugins/) is pretty good on its own), but I wanted to put up a quick note that my slides and companion code are available online.

You can view the slides over on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/u/markupboy/p/diving-in-practical-tips-for-custom-plugin-development) and [a repository for the code](https://github.com/markupboy/Custom-Plugin-Dev-EECI-2012) has been created over on GitHub.

Thanks to everyone that made it out!
