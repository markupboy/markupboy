There are few things I love more on the internet that seeing what helps peoples' digital lives tick.  This is my attempt to share my little corner of the internet.

##Gear

Most people that know me say I have at least a few to many computers.  Honestly, I can't argue with that. I have a soft spot for [Apple](http://www.apple.com) and am rarely more than arms length away from a device connected to the Internet.

For photography work I use an [oddly trash can shaped hex-core Mac Pro](http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/) hooked up to a massive 34" ultrawide monitor and a gaming monitor that sadly doesn't see a lot of gaming these days.

On the go, I prefer my diminutive [13" Touchbar Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro) which, despite some pretty usual keyboard issues, I still really enjoy (even if I'm not as smitten as with my old 11" Air). At home I have a beast of a custom built Windows whose entire purpose is watching [Twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv) and playing PC games. Oh, and of course I have an [iPhone X](http://www.apple.com/iphone/).

All of my media gets served from a [QNAP NAS](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/product/tvs-871) filled with 32TB of drives and hooked up to way too much [enterprise grade networking gear](http://ubnt.com) for a private residence and a [Mac Mini Server](http://www.apple.com/macmini/server/) on top of a home-built [unRAID server](https://lime-technology.com) for odds and ends like automatic downloads, time machine backups, and continuous integration and automated testing.

For travel, I have an [iPad Pro](http://www.apple.com/ipad/), a [Kindle Voyage](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IOY8XWQ/ref=ods_fs_kv) when I want to do serious reading, and a pile of [Nikon](http://www.nikonusa.com/) gear for when I want to take a photograph.

All of my keyboards are [of the mechanical persuasion](http://elitekeyboards.com/) and my mice are [Razer](http://mrkp.me/2m).

##Tools

Good hardware is nothing without good software.  I do my best to keep a fairly limited set of tools at my disposal and all have been heavily customized to my process at this point.

All of my code, articles, notes, and to-do lists are written in [Atom](http://www.atom.io/). I browse the internet with [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/). Version my code with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Github](http://www.github.com). Read my feeds with [Reeder](http://reederapp.com). Perform backups with [SuperDuper](http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) and [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com). Manage photos with [Lightroom](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html). Move files with [Transmit](http://www.panic.com/transmit). See what people are talking about with [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/).

And my entire digital life is in the hands of [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com).

##The Site

This site's design is a heavily modified version of the Information Architects' [iA3 Wordpress Theme](http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/ia3/) built with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) and hosted entirely on [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
