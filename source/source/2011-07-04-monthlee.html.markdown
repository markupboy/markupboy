__MonthlEE__ is a simple ExpressionEngine plugin that takes in a number from 1 to 12 and returns the corresponding month name.

This plugin can be helpful in turning monthly/yearly archive urls into nicely formatted month names for headers.  For instance, if you have the url http://www.example.com/archive/2011/06, month name can help create a nicely formatted header like:

<code>Archives for {exp:month_name month="{segment_3}"} {segment_2}</code>

Which will output __Archives for June 2011__


[MonthlEE can be downloaded from its addon page on Devot-EE](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/monthlee/)
