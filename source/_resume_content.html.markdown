My career as I know it started way back in 1995. I designed and built my first website that year. It was awful. A local music group paid \$50 for a site full of frames, tables, and font tags that ignited a passion and would lead to an entire career. Along the way, I've built websites, web applications, and engineering organizations for small businesses, global brands, and high growth startups.

Currently, my focus is on product engineering leadership. I'm proud to lead a division of talented engineering teams that are building and shipping products and platforms for customers around the world. I aim to build highly effective engineering organizations, empower teams and individuals to operate independently, and help them ship impactful features to users quickly and reliably.

Today, I'm a Senior Director of Engineering for the CI/CD Engine Division at [CircleCI](http://www.circleci.com), working remotely out of my home in Longmont, CO. Outside of work, I'm a husband and a dad, a devoted Formula 1 fan, and lifelong gamer.
