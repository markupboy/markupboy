My career as I know it started way back in 1995. I designed and built my first website that year. It was awful. A local music group paid \$50 for a site full of frames, tables, and font tags that ignited a passion and would lead to an entire career. Along the way, I've built websites, web applications, and engineering organizations for small businesses, global brands, and world-class startups.

Currently, my focus is on product engineering leadership. I'm proud to lead a division of talented engineering teams that are building and shipping products and platforms for customers around the world. I aim to build highly effective engineering organizations, empower teams and individuals to operate independently, and help them ship impactful features to users quickly and reliably.

Today, I'm a Senior Director of Engineering and Head of Engineer for the CI/CD Engine at [CircleCI](http://www.circleci.com), working remotely out of my home in Longmont, CO. Outside of work, I'm a husband and a dad, an avid amateur photographer, a serious car nut, and spend what little free time I have left playing as many video games as possible.
