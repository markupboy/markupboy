My career as I know it started way back in 1995. I designed and built my first website that year. It was awful. A local music group paid \$50 for a site full of frames, tables, and font tags that ignited a passion and would lead to an entire career. Along the way, I've built websites, web applications, and engineering organizations for small businesses, global brands, and world-class startups.

Currently, my focus is on product engineering leadership. I'm proud to lead a division of talented engineering teams that are building and shipping products and platforms for customers around the world. I aim to build highly effective engineering organizations, empower teams and individuals to operate independently, and help them ship impactful features to users quickly and reliably.

Today, I'm the Director of Engineering for Growth and Data at [CircleCI](http://www.circleci.com), working remotely out of my home in Longmont, CO. Outside of work, I'm a husband and a dad, an avid amateur photographer, a serious car nut, and spend what little free time I have left playing as many video games as possible.
